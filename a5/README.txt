How long did the assignment take?
{A1: 10 hours}
Potential issues with your solution and explanation of partial completion (for partial credit)
{A2: Unsure of HDR function because output imagea are really dark. This also brings into question the output of the tone mapping as it calls HDR to produce its results. The images from the tone mapping seem reasonable, however, }
Any extra credit you may have implemented
{A3: None}
Collaboration acknowledgement (but again, you must write your own code)
{A4: cliu2014}
What was most unclear/difficult?
{A5: Make HDR was straightforward conceptualy but subtle and easily made mistakes led to hours of debugging (forgot to copy an array so there was a shared reference). Also the output of seems as if little was done to make the images better. }
What was most exciting?
{A6: The output of the tone mapping is beautiful. }
